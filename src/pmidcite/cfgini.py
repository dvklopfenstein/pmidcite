# NIH citations will always be downloaded.

# To work off-line and store citation data downloaded from the NIH,

# from the NIH will then be stored in its own p<PMID>.py file for
# later use when there is no internet available.

# Specify the directory to store citation data from the NIH that is downloaded

#  # with 2 citations and 18 references that is authored by 2 (au[02]) people with

# Thousands of NIH citation files may be downloaded for a literature search
# on a single subject. It is not necessary to save the NIH citation data and I
# recommend not saving these files using git managed from the cloud.
#
# Note: Add an __init__.py file to the ./icite directory
#       Add /icite to the .gitignore to avoid saving thousands of unecessary files using git
#
# Recommended value, None or ./icite:
# dir_icite_py = None
# dir_icite_py = ./icite  # $ mkdir ./icite
dir_icite_py = None

# Store abstracts and publication data downloaded form PubMed in a dedicated directory

# Recommended value (mkdir ./log; mkdir ./log/pubmed):
# dir_pubmed_txt = ./log/pubmed
dir_pubmed_txt = None

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Store files containing longer lists of PMIDs into a dedicated directory
# specified using the variable, dir_pmids.
# Files containing lists of PMIDs can be downloaded either from the PubMed GUI
# or by running a PubMed query from your copy of pmidcite's dnld_pmids.py script.
#
# Store NIH citation data for all PMIDs in a single file into a directory
# dedicated to citation data files using the variable, dir_icite.
