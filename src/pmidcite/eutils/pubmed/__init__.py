# Note: This assumes that -e is the last of line. But you can capture it otherwise if it is not suitable to your case.
# 
# Explanation:
#   * %s#\(.*\) - captures the line before the -e.
#   * \zs\ze    - starts and stops the match here.
#   * -e#       - just before the -e.
#   * Using \zs and \ze here let us to add our spaces directly before -e (otherwise concatenation with .submatch(x) would have been possible).
#   * \=repeat(' ',58-len(submatch(1))) - replace this location with a variable number of spaces and where 58 is your aimed column.
