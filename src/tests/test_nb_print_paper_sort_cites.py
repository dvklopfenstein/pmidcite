# ## 1) Load Python interface to NIH-OCC's API
# One NIH entry per PubMed ID (PMID) will be downloaded to the directory, `./icite`.
#
# It is not advisable to add these files to a repo or revision manage them because the number of files will multitudinous.
# So ensure `./icite` is listed in the `.gitignore` file.
#
# NOTE: The Python API always downloads data from the NIH-OCC, even if it has been requested before. The Python downloader, `NIHiCiteDownloader`, will load NIH-OCC data from a file if it exists, otherwise will download the data using the API.
